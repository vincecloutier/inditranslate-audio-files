# IndiTranslate
IndiTranslate was created after my work in a hospice home during the pandemic. It is a tool that allows staff to communicate with single-language Indigenous elders. The translations are focused on procedural norms in these homes. This project was supported by the Future Design School through the Audrey Wearn Language Prize.

## What is this repository for?
