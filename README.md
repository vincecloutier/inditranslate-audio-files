# What is IndiTranslate?
IndiTranslate was created after my work in a hospice home during the pandemic. It is a tool that allows staff to communicate with single-language Indigenous elders. The translations are focused on procedural norms in these homes.

# What is this repo for?
This repository is meant to help lower the barrier of entry for building solutions to Indigenous language problems.

# Funding?
This project is supported by Future Design School through the Audrey Wearn Language Prize.
